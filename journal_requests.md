2. 格式要求(format requested) **只有满足格式要求的提交才会被处理**

   - [ ] **论文原创性说明**

      A statement that this manuscript is your “*original unpublished work and the manuscript or any variation of it has not been submitted to another publication previously*.” This journal does not consider papers rejected by other journals. You may request an exception to this policy but must submit ALL the correspondence and reviews received from the journal that rejected your paper.

   - [ ] **按照模板(双栏)排版的论文原稿(pdf文档)**

     The pdf file of your paper prepared in double-column according to the attached journal template. This will be used to determine the length of your paper as journal pages which is generally limited to 16 journal pages. There is a charge of $250 per page for extra pages beyond 16 pages. If your paper is longer than 16 template pages please confirm you are in a position to pay for the overage fee.

Please disclose potential conflicts of interest if any.

   - [ ] **10名领域内研究者**

     该文件须为word文件，内容包括10名领域内研究者以及其联系邮箱。该文件的目的是表明作者是否熟悉该领域的最新发展，可能会在该名单中寻找审稿人。有人会问5和6的区别，我认为它们的差别不大，可能文件5中的6名领军者是资深的研究者，6中的10名会包含一些新的研究者。我是把它们处理成了从属关系，文件5中的内容是文件6中的前6名研究者。

Journal contributors automatically become a member of the Society of CACAIE. There is no membership fee but they **commit to provide detailed reviews for papers submitted to the journal** as the journal reviewers are often chosen among contributors to the journal. This is how thoughtful and detailed reviews are obtained in a timely fashion (guidelines available on the journal web site [here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/pb-assets/assets/14678667/CACAIE_editorial-1509465300000.pdf)).

## 2. 手稿准备Manuscript preparation

- [ ] major original contribution 不超过40页
- [ ] short original contribution 不超过16页
- [ ] title page: 标题, 作者, 单位
- [ ] 通讯作者必须是老师,并负责提交论文
- [ ] abstract 100-150词

Authors should consult a recent issue of the journal for style and layout if possible. The length of the manuscript a major original contribution should be limited to **40 pages** including tables and figures. The length of a short original contribution should be limited to **16 pages** including tables and figures. The title page should contain the title, author(s) name(s) and affiliation(s), including a complete address for correspondence and proofs. When a graduate student/PostDoc or a junior researcher is the co-author of a manuscript **we ask the professor/advisor to submit it and be the corresponding author** because he/she is in an experienced position to appreciate issues of originality, copyright assignment, and the high standard of publication of rigorously peer-reviewed research journals. Each paper should be provided with an **abstract of 100-150 words**, reporting concisely on the purpose and results of the paper. The title of the paper should unambiguously reflect its contents. The **title of the paper should not exceed 70 characters** including blank spaces. Please avoid using abbreviations in the title. The Editor reserves the right to adjust style to certain standards of uniformity.  The **SI system** should be used for all scientific and laboratory data; if, in certain instances, it is necessary to quote other units, these should be added in parentheses. Temperatures should be given in degrees Celsius. The unit 'billion' (109 in America, 1012 in Europe) is ambiguous and should not be used.  Tables (numbered consecutively with Arabic numerals), references and legends to illustrations should be typed on separate sheets and placed at the end of the paper.  Footnotes should be avoided especially if they contain information which could equally well be included in the text.

Authors are asked to deliver the final versions of their accepted manuscript on disk or CD. To do so, please adhere to the following guidelines: Submit your electronic file either in MS-DOS, Windows, or Macintosh format. LATEX or ASCII files are preferred. However, any word-processing software will be accepted. Send the native file and an ASCII copy. **Name the file with your last name.** Label the disk with your name, the file name, the program and versions used as well as the operating system. (For example, Smith, Smith.doc, Word 6.0, Windows.) Submit each **illustration or figure** as a separate file without captions. Name the file as it will appear in text. (For example, Figure 1, Figure 2, etc.) If using a program other than that used for the text, specify the program and version used. Submission by email is also encouraged. Emailed files should be **combined and encoded in a standard way**, for example, tarred and unencoded for UNIX. Author's name and the journal should appear in the subject line of the email, for example, Smith, CACAIE. Accepted articles can be emailed to: [adeli.1@osu.edu](mailto:adeli.1@osu.edu). All disk or email submissions should be accompanied by two hard copies of the revised manuscript prepared according to the journal style guidelines and typed in single column and double-spaced. The hard copy must match the digital file (disk/CD). All submissions should also include the author's e-mail address and a signed Copyright Assignment Form.

## 4. 数学表达式Mathematical notation

Please type all formulas for clarity. Identify special symbols when they first occur. Distinguish between '0' (zero) and capital and lower case 'O' (oh) and between the lower case 'l' (ell) and arabic number '1' (one).

## 5. 参考文献 References

References should be cited at the appropriate point in the text by the last name of the author followed by the year of publication in parentheses.

## 6. 插图Illustrations

- [ ] 插图的原件和复印件,每张图打印在一章纸上
- [ ] 文章排版范围177mm宽 × 240mm高, 双栏排版,单栏85mm, 7pt字
- [x] 彩印必须额外付钱,本文不需要考虑这个问题

The original and a copy of each illustration should be provided and each illustration should be printed out on a separate sheet. Line drawings may be submitted in any medium providing that the image is black and very sharp. They should preferably all require the same degree of reduction; large diagrams, more than four times final size, are discouraged due to handling difficulties. The type area of the journal is 177 mm wide x 240 mm deep, in two columns per page, each 85 mm wide, and lettering should therefore be large enough to be legible after reduction of the illustration to fit (ideally 7 pt lettering after reduction). Photographs should be submitted as contrasting black-and-white prints on glossy paper. Each illustration must be clearly numbered and the name(s) of the author(s) of the paper written on the reverse side. Color figures will be published in color only if the author can pay for the additional cost of printing in color through his/her own research sponsor or other sources.

## 7. Proofs

the author (or the corresponding author where several are involved) will receive a set of proofs for information purposes. No new material may be inserted in the text at the time of proofreading unless accepted by the Editor AND a fee paid by the author for any changes made at the proofreading stage.

## 8. Offprints

Free access to the final PDF offprint or your article will be available via Wiley Author Services. Please register to access your article PDF offprint and enjoy the many other benefits the service offers. Visit [authorservices.wiley.com](https://authorservices.wiley.com/home.html) to register.

##  9. Note to NIH Grantees

Pursuant to NIH mandate, Wiley-Blackwell will post the accepted version of contributions authored by NIH grant-holders to PubMed Central upon acceptance. This accepted version will be made publicly available 12 months after publication. For further information, see [www.wiley.com/go/nihmandate](http://www.wiley.com/go/nihmandate).
